Website for a FoodCom, a catering company based in Jeonju, Korea. Via this web app clients can make personalized requests for catering services. 

The frontend was built with Next.js, and the backend was built with Django. 

We've also integrated a Telegram bot that notifies FoodCom of any new requests and allows for no-code management of all images on the website. It's running on AWS LightSail.
